## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I have chosen to work on Medical cost dataset (**insurance.csv**). I think, this dataset was primarily developed for the insurance forecast and it can help medical insurance companies to develop more accurate pricing models and plan a better insurance outcome. This Medical cost dataset contains the Medical Insurance Cost/charge of a small sample of USA population based on some attributes such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoker/non-smoker, residential area. 

### Interest in this dataset:
This dataset contains some health-related information which I found very interesting. I am always very interested to know how health factors are related to living habits and area of living. The dataset can answer to some possible queries (might change or add some other later as the project develops over time) which I want to explore:
1.	Is there any relationship between age/sex and bmi or bmi and smoking habit?
2.	People of which area are more likely to be smoker or more likely to be healthy with standard BMI?
3.	Which area charges the highest?
4.	Relationship between no of children and charges?
5.	How the attributes like age and sex are related to charges?
6.	Relationship between age and smoking habit.


## Description of the dataset(in about 150-200 words)

### Dataset Specifications:
This dataset contains 1,338 records(rows), each with 7 attributes(columns). The attribute “charges” indicates the medical costs billed by health insurance company. The rest of the columns contain personal information such as age, gender, family status, and whether the patient smokes or not etc.

### Attributes/Columns:
 [1]	age: Age of the patient. [Ordinal]
